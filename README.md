# RTBulletin

A website that pulls data from YouTube and reddit to display the last week's uploads from Rooster Teeth and its sister channels. Link is [here](http://csdept19.mtech.edu/rtb/), but it will likely not remain up.

The project uses a mysql database that holds channels and videos with associated data about them. The web page uses Javascript with ajax calls to php files to update the content of the page. The board itself uses flexbox and CSS to be responsive and have the "bulletin board" like feel I was aiming for.
